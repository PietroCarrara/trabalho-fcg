#  Slenderman: The OpenGL Pages

A recreation of the old, viral game "Slenderman: The Eight Pages". Done in pairs as the final assignment for the Graphical Computing subject at UFRGS.

## Libraries

- For graphics, we used OpenGL
- For audio, we used miniaudio
- For windowing and input, we used glfw


## Building

Honestly, I don't remember how we built it. It looks like the very poor """build system""" that we did at `run.sh` should work. Don't judge, okay? We were in a hurry.

## The Result

If I remember correctly, this one did end up in the "hall of fame", where it gets displayed every semester at the top of the moodle page for the subject. We were very proud of it!

Some parts may look weird or out of place. That is either because we had to fulfill some requirement (such as implementing blinn phong shading for one object, and gouraud shading
for others), or because we didn't have proper assets for something (the trees, for example, come from SuperMario64!).

You can see a bit of the gameplay on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Ef8ORgEm0) (CONTAINS JUMPSCARE!! CAREFUL!!). It's more of a demonstration for the teacher, but it shows the result.
